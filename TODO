TODO and Notes for LionMail and EmailMessage applets:
------------------------------------------------------


LionMail:
- test and fix switching collection (clear list?)
- multiple collections:
    - config key (QStringList of ID's)
    - show loading emails in extenderitem's infolabel
- getting collection list on startup is slow

EmailMessage:
- QDragging
    - proper URL / Mimetype mixture in QMimeData
    - How do we load the dropped data?
    - fix dragging from inside Lion Mail after email has been expanded
- parsing of the content to nicer HTML
- security: in HTML mode, images are always loaded
- putting "something sensible" info in the To field
- header webview should become Plasma::Label
- test and fix monitoring
- saving of config in extenderitem
- collection icons in widgetlist
- Are multiple flags in Akonadi possible?
- clearing and reloading the MailExtender's content on config changes

General:
- Retrieval of a contact based on an email address for example (not supported in Akonadi atm)
- Sorting of collectionfetchjobs, preferably by receiving order
- Contact plasmoid?


Questions:
- Multiple flags in Akonadi?
- Sorting of fetchJobs
- custom collections ("virtual folders")
